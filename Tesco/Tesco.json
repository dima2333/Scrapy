The used teabag can be easily disposed of in most recycling collects as they are made from organic materials which break down meaning they can be composted.\r\n\r\nFinal Evaluation:\r\n\r\nI like the tea and I would have the tea again.

I love the names of each of the different flavours and the little comment on the front of each bag packaging. I also love that they are individually wrapped for freshness, just another fantastic perk. My favourite was the \u201cfeel new\u201d one, after feeling a little run down and poorly, this tea was so comforting and made me feel relaxed but also revived at the same time. I also loved the night time tea, this helps to relax you and even the smell makes you feel so cosy and comfortable. I also really liked the inside of the box lots of little paragraphs about life and also about how these tea bags are fair trade and the do everyone a little good, so uplifting and a just made me smile so a great little addition.

The flavour was well balanced and not too strong on the lemon or ginger.\r\n\r\nFor me personally, the other 3 variants were not to my taste as they are all heavy on liquorice or anise which I don't enjoy, however, for someone who doesn't mind these I'm sure they'd be great, my partner was a fan!\r\n\r\nThe tea is very high quality and is also organic which is a plus!

They called by and called by! So I ordered another 48 bottles to be on the safe side, which was drunk with much approval on the evening, though there is just sufficient left for that late afternoon glass brought out to me on the dark evenings after a days gardening or similar.\nI don't do the flowery language normally used to describe wines; this tastes like the best offerings on the ski slopes, the genuine article.
